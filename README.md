### 1.Project Motivation

As many of you know, Danish player Eriksen suffered a heart attack in the 45th minute of the match between Denmark and Finland in the Euro2020 Tournament. This view scared the whole world and me.<br />
<br />
So what is this Heart Attack? What could be causing this?<br />
<br />
A heart attack happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn’t get enough blood. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart muscle.
Now we know what a Heart Attack is. Now it’s time to find out what a heart attack depend on.
